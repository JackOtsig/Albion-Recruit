# Albion-Recruit
A b0t for Albion that spams guild recruitment ads and then auto-invites anyone who responds
You gotta change the mouse click coords to fit your screen, and also the screenshot area
otherwise should work perfectly
my step by step process for using is
1: run the program
2: you have about 5 seconds after starting it to tab into albion
3: click a few times and I like to press enter twice for good luck
4: let it do its thing
5: to stop it make sure it's not close to sending another message then just kill it
should run indefinitely
let me know of any bugs you encounter, I've already had to deal with barcode names and accents
first fully functioning code uploaded :)
